## Overview

### The challenge (Frontend Only)

Users should be able to:

&#9745; Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
&#9745; Receive error messages when the form is submitted if any input field is empty
&#9745; Receive error messages when the form is submitted if the card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
&#9745; View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
&#9745; See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Backend Development

I have built a backend in Django to accompany this Frontend Mentor project. This includes a PostgreSQL database connected to the web form using Django Models and the ModelForm API.

I have also included both frontend and backend validation of form inputs.
